# Behavioral Health Research in Primary Care
### <br /> Jake Hedges, LMHC CPS <br /> Ivan Castro, MSPH <br /> <br /> VISN2 Center for Integrated Healthcare

---


## What is the Center for Integrated Healthcare?  

--

__Mission__  

&gt;To improve the healthcare of Veterans by integrating mental health prevention and treatment services into the primary care setting.  

__Vision__  

&gt;To be a national resource regarding the integration of mental health in primary care.  

---

### Two cores of CIH  

__Education and Implementation Services__   

- Train providers of integrated primary care nationally and advise on best practices.  

- Promote implementation of evidence-based primary care mental health services.  

--

__Research__  

- Focuses on discovering more effective and efficient ways to identify and treat mental health concerns in primary care.  

  - Brief assessment and intervention  
  
- High priority areas include: substance use, PTSD, depression, sleep disturbances

# Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI)

---

## Why PCMHI? 

- Population-based care  
  - Brief: 30 minute appts, 1-5 sessions  
  
- Improves Identification  
  - Identification of depression, psychiatric co-morbidities, and substance misuse _in primary care_.  
  
- Improves Access  
  - Reduces wait time for mental health services  
  - Reduces no-show rates  
  
- Engagement in Care  
  - Same-day services in PCMHI increase the odds of attending future mental health appointments and engaging in specialty treatment (OMH, PCT, STS).  
  
--


&gt;*VA primary care patients with a positive PTSD screen who receive same-day PC-MHI services are 3 times more likely to initiate PTSD treatment.*   
&gt; 
&gt;Bohnert et al. (2016)

---

__Examples of PCMHI interventions__  

- Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Chronic Pain  

- Tobacco Use Cessation: A Brief Primary Care Intervention  

- Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care (PE-PC)  

- Brief CBT for Insomnia

# Conducting research within Primary Care 
---

## Why Primary Care?  

- Mental health disorders are common among patients in VA primary care  
  - yet, many don't seek treatment
  - or allow referrals to specialty mental health services to lapse  
  
- Around 11% meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD)  

- 12% meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)  

- Up to 20% of patients in VA primary care clinics experience PTSD symptoms  
  - of those, 40% also meet criteria for AUD  

--

- Mental illness is associated with negative outcomes across all aspects of well-being  
  - co-morbidity between disorders: PTSD, depression, AUD and anxiety  
  
  - associated with physical health: CVD, diabetes, hypertension  
  
  - impaired functioning: unemployment, relationship problems, poverty  
  
---

## Clinical Research  

- Safety assessments  

  - Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test  
  - P4 Suicide Screener  
  - Breathalyzer  
  
- Diagnostic assessments  
  
  - Clinician Administered PTSD Scale  

- Self-report assessments  

  - PTSD Checklist for DSM-5  
  - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test  
  - Patient Health Questionnaire  
  - Substance Use Motives Questionnaire  

---

## Recruitment  

- Patients are recruited from VA primary care clinics  
  - recruitment letter and phone screens  

- In-person interviews at baseline  
  - those eligible for a study are randomized to experimental treatment or treatment-as-usual.  
  
- Inclusion criteria

  - diagnostic level (or subthreshold) PTSD  
      - PCL-5 &gt;= 30  
  - hazardous alcohol use  
      - AUDIT 6-25 (women) or 8-25 (men)  
  
- Exclusion criteria  
  - gross cognitive impairment  
  - recent suicidal intent or attempt  
  - current psychotherapy for PTSD  
  - medication:  
      - changes in last 2 months for PTSD  
      - or current prescription for substance use (alcohol studies)  
  - desire to begin specialty care  

---

## Some studies we're involved in

- **Clinician-supported PTSD Coach**  
  - study incorporates use of a mobile app and focuses on increasing patient's ability to manage symptoms, and preparing them for further treatment if needed.  
  
- **Primary Care Brief Mindfulness Training**  
  - mindfulness training is not psychotherapy, but these classes are meant to help veterans increase emotional regulation skills.  
  
- **Primary Care Treatment Integrating Motivation and Exposure**  
  - study focuses on decreasing alcohol use _and_ PTSD symptoms by integrating PE-PC and motivational interviewing for alcohol use.  
  
- **Peer-Delivered Whole Health Coaching**  
  - intervention is _not_ focused on PTSD symptoms, and is ideal for Veterans with PTSD who are reluctant to talk about behavioral problems.  
  
---

## Challenges to recruitment and engagement

- Reluctance to talk about trauma  

- Stigma/Motivation to change   

- Denying PTSD symptoms or under-reporting substance use    

--

- Perceptions  
  - *Don't waste resources on me*  
  - *This should go to someone who really needs it*   
  - *I don't have a drinking problem*  

--

- Assessments can be exhausting and frustrating  
 
- Studies may require 'homework', or use of tools at home  

--

- Meeting criteria for PTSD and severity cut-offs  

- Scheduling conflicts, not enough time to participate in study  

---

## How we address challenges

- Motivational interviewing  
  - help clarify understanding of PTSD or AUD  
  - help reframe their perceived barriers   

- Explaining that participation may help other veterans  
  - some are more motivated to help others than themselves  

- Rewording/rephrasing interventions in order to reduce stigma  
  - mindfulness *class* or *training*, instead of group    
  - talk about *low mood*, instead of depression  
  - avoiding framing alcohol use as *drinking to cope*  
  
- Clarify as much as possible, keep veteran connected with the bigger picture of the study

**Change the way we think about mental health**  

- When we think about cancer, heart disease, or diabetes, we don’t wait years to treat them.  
- Encourage people to [get screened](https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools)  

- It’s up to all of us to know the signs and take action so that mental illnesses can be caught early and treated.
