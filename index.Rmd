# Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI)

---

## Why PCMHI? 

- Improves Identification  

  - Identification of depression, psychiatric co-morbidities, and substance misuse _in primary care_.  
  
- Improves Access  

  - Reduces wait time for mental health services  
  - Reduces no-show rates  
  
- Engagement in Care  

  - Same-day services in PCMHI increase the odds of attenting future mental health appointments and engaging in specialty treatment (OMH, PCT, STS).  
  
--

__Examples of PCMHI interventions__  

- Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Chronic Pain  
- Tobacco Use Cessation: A Brief Primary Care Intervention  
- Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care (PE-PC)  
- Brief CBT for Insomnia

# Conducting research within Primary Care 
---

## Clinical Research  

- Safety assessments  

  - Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test  
  - P4 Suicide Screener  
  - Breathalyzer  
  
- Diagnostic assessments  
  
  - Clinician Administered PTSD Scale  

- Self-report assessments  

  - PTSD Checklist for DSM-5  
  - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test  
  - Patient Health Questionnaire  
  - Substance Use Motives Questionnaire  

---

## Recruitment  

- Patients are recruited from VA primary care clinics  
  - recruitment letter and phone screens  

- In-person interviews at baseline  
  - those eligible for a study are randomized to experimental treatment or treatment-as-usual.  
  
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria 

---

## Some studies we're involved with

- Clinician-supported PTSD Coach  
  - study incorporates use of a mobile app and focuses on increasing patient's ability to manage symptoms, and preparing them for further treatment if needed.  
  
- Primary Care Brief Mindfulness Training  
  - mindfulness training is not psychotherapy, but these classes are meant to help veterans increase emotional regulation skills.  
  
- Primary Care Treatment Integrating Motivation and Exposure  
  - study focuses on decreasing alcohol use _and_ PTSD symptoms by integrating PE-PC and motivational interviewing for alcohol use.  
  
- Peer-Delivered Whole Health Coaching  
  - intervention is _not_ focused on PTSD symptoms, and is ideal for Veterans with PTSD who are reluctant to talk about behavioral problems.

## Challenges to Recruitment and Engagement

- Reluctance to talk about trauma  

- Stigma/Motivation to change   

- "Don't waste resources on me", "This should go to someone who really needs it"

--

- Assessments can be exhausting and frustrating  
 
- Studies may require "homework", use of tools at home
